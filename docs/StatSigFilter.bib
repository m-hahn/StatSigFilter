	of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence
	parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative
	memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive
	principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R)
	architecture, and our process model is realized in ACT-R.We present the results of 6 sets of simulations:
	5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on
	both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of
	double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-
	embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model‚Äôs complete reliance on discriminating
	retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained
	with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT-R
	defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference

We also provide a quantitative random-effects meta-analysis of self-paced and eyetracking reading studies. We show that the empirical evidence is only partly consistent with cue-based retrieval as implemented in the ACT-R-based model of sentence processing by Lewis \& Vasishth 2005 (LV05) and that there are important differences between the reviewed dependency types. In non-agreement subject-verb dependencies, there is evidence for inhibitory interference in configurations where the correct dependent fully matches the retrieval cues. This is consistent with the LV05 cue-based retrieval account. By contrast, in subject-verb agreement as well as in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent dependencies, no evidence for interference is found in configurations with a fully cue-matching subject. In configurations with only a partially cue-matching subject or antecedent, the meta-analysis revealed facilitatory interference in subject-verb agreement and inhibitory interference in reflexives/reciprocals. The former is consistent with the LV05 account, but the latter is not. Moreover, the meta-analysis revealed that  (i) interference type (proactive versus retroactive) leads to different effects in the reviewed dependency types; and (ii) the prominence of the distractor has an important impact on the interference effect. 
In sum, the meta-analysis suggests that the LV05 needs important modifications to account for (i) the unexplained interference patterns and (ii) the differences between the dependency types. More generally, the meta-analysis provides a quantitative empirical basis for comparing the predictions of competing accounts of retrieval processes in sentence comprehension.},

  abstract = {
We present a model of cue-based retrieval in sentence processing that formalizes (i) memory accessibility (prominence) and (ii) a theory of associative cues as extensions to the ACT-R model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005). The extensions are independently motivated and, compared to the original model, enable more differentiated predictions with respect to the experimental design of individual experiments as well as differences between retrieval contexts. The predictions of the original and the extended model are compared with the results of a comprehensive Bayesian meta-analysis of published studies on retrieval interference in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent and subject-verb dependencies (Jäger, Engelmann, Vasishth, submitted). Quantitative simulations show that the extended model accounts for effects that are outside the scope of the original model. The results emphasize the importance of accounting for different aspects of memory accessibility, for individual study design, and context-based feature-selectivity in order to generate accurate predictions of a model of cue-based memory retrieval. The simulation results thus shed new light on the cognitive mechanisms un- derlying interference effects and should be considered in the interpretation of the available data and in the design of future experiments.},

  abstract = {Delaying the appearance of a verb in a noun-verb dependency tends to increase processing difficulty at the verb; one explanation for this locality effect is decay and/or interference of the noun in working memory. Surprisal, an expectation-based account, predicts that delaying the appearance of a verb either renders it no more predictable or more predictable, leading respectively to a prediction of no effect of distance or a facilitation.  Recently, Husain et al (2014) suggested that when the exact identity of the upcoming verb is predictable (strong predictability), increasing argument-verb distance leads to facilitation effects, which is consistent with surprisal; but when the exact identity of the upcoming verb is not predictable (weak predictability), locality effects are seen. We investigated Husain et al.'s proposal using Persian complex predicates (CPs), which consist of a non-verbal element---a noun in the current study---and a verb. In CPs, once the noun has been read, the exact identity of the verb is highly predictable (strong predictability); this was confirmed using a sentence completion study. In two self-paced reading (SPR) and two eye-tracking (ET) experiments, we delayed the appearance of the verb by interposing a relative clause (Expt. 1 and 3) or a long PP (Expt. 2 and 4). 
We also included a simple Noun-Verb predicate configuration with the same distance manipulation; here, the exact identity of the verb was not predictable (weak predictability). Thus, the design crossed Predictability Strength and Distance.  We found that, consistent with surprisal, the verb in the strong predictability conditions was read faster than in the weak predictability conditions. Furthermore, greater verb-argument distance led to slower reading times;  strong predictability did not neutralize or attenuate the locality effects. As regards the effect of distance on dependency resolution difficulty, these four experiments  present evidence in favor of  working memory accounts of argument-verb dependency resolution, and against the surprisal-based expectation account of Levy (2008). However, another expectation-based measure, entropy, which was computed using the offline sentence completion data, predicts reading times in Experiment 1. We suggest that forgetting due to memory overload leads to greater entropy at the verb.}

Recently, several self-paced reading studies have presented surprising evidence that object relatives in Chinese are easier to process than subject relatives. We carried out three self-paced reading experiments that attempted to replicate these results. Two of our three studies found a subject-relative preference, and the third study found an object-relative advantage. Using a random effects Bayesian meta-analysis of fifteen studies (including our own), we show that the overall current evidence for the subject-relative advantage is quite strong (approximate posterior probability of a subject-relative advantage given the data: 78–80%). We argue that retrieval/integration based accounts would have difficulty explaining all three experimental results. These findings are important because they narrow the theoretical space by limiting the role of an important class of explanation—retrieval/integration cost—at least for relative clause processing in Chinese.},

linguistic relation (e.g., a verb and a noun phrase argument) increases the difficulty of establishing that
relation during on-line comprehension. Such locality effects are expected to increase reading times and
are thought to reveal properties and limitations of the short-term memory system that supports comprehension.
Despite their theoretical importance and putative ubiquity, however, evidence for on-line
locality effects is quite narrow linguistically and methodologically: It is restricted almost exclusively to
self-paced reading of complex structures involving a particular class of syntactic relation. We present 4
experiments (2 self-paced reading and 2 eyetracking experiments) that demonstrate locality effects in the
course of establishing subject-verb dependencies; locality effects are seen even in materials that can be
read quickly and easily. These locality effects are observable in the earliest possible eye-movement
measures and are of much shorter duration than previously reported effects. To account for the observed
empirical patterns, we outline a processing model of the adaptive control of button pressing and eye
movements. This model makes progress toward the goal of eliminating linking assumptions between
memory constructs and empirical measures in favor of explicit theories of the coordinated control of
motor responses and parsing.},

The memory-based accounts predict that object relatives are easier to process than subject relatives because, in object relatives, the distance between the relative clause verb and the head  noun is shorter. By contrast, expectation-based accounts such as surprisal predict that the less frequent object relative should be harder to process. In previous studies on  Chinese relative clause comprehension, local ambiguities may have rendered a comparison  between relative clause types uninterpretable. We designed experimental materials in which no local ambiguities confound the comparison. We ran two experiments (self-paced reading  and eye-tracking) to compare reading difficulty in subject and object relatives which were  placed either in subject or object modifying position.

Previous work (Boston, Hale, Vasishth, & Kliegl, 2011) has shown that surprisal (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and cue-based mem- ory retrieval (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005) are significant and complementary predictors of reading time in an eyetracking corpus. It remains an open question how the sentence processor interacts with oculomotor control. Using a simple linking hypothesis proposed in Reichle, Warren, and McConnell (2009), we integrated both measures with the eye movement model EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) inside the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004). We built a reading model that could initiate short “Time Out 
regressions” (Mitchell, Shen, Green, & Hodgson, 2008) that compensate for slow postlexical processing. This simple interaction enabled the model to predict the re-reading of words based on parsing difficulty. The model was evaluated in different configurations on the prediction of frequency effects on the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. The extension of EMMA with postlexical processing improved its predictions and reproduced re-reading rates and durations with a reasonable fit to the data. This demonstration, based on simple and independently motivated assumptions, serves as a foundational step toward a precise investigation of the interaction between high-level language processing and eye movement control.},

This tutorial provides a practical introduction to fitting LMMs in a Bayesian framework using the probabilistic programming language Stan. We choose Stan (rather than WinBUGS or JAGS) because it provides an elegant and scalable framework for fitting models in most of the standard applications of LMMs. We ease the reader into fitting increasingly complex LMMs, using a two-condition repeated measures self-paced reading study.},

  abstract = {This is the first attempt at characterizing reading difficulty in Hindi using naturally occurring sentences. We created the Potsdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus by recording eye-movement data from 30 participants at the University of Allahabad, India. The target stimuli were 153 sentences selected from the beta version of the Hindi-Urdu treebank. We find that word- or low-level predictors (syllable length, unigram and bigram frequency) affect first-pass reading times, regression path duration, total reading time, and outgoing saccade length. An increase in syllable length results in longer fixations, and an increase in word unigram and bigram frequency leads to shorter fixations. Longer syllable length and higher frequency lead to longer outgoing saccades. We also find that two predictors of sentence comprehension diffi- culty, integration and storage cost, have an effect on reading difficulty. Integration cost (Gibson, 2000) was approximated by calculating the distance (in words) between a dependent and head; and storage cost (Gibson, 2000), which measures difficulty of maintaining predictions, was estimated by counting the number of predicted heads at each point in the sentence. We find that integration cost mainly affects outgoing saccade length, and storage cost affects total reading times and outgoing saccade length. Thus, word-level predictors have an effect in both early and late measures of reading time, while predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty tend to affect later measures. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration using eye-tracking that both integration and storage cost influence reading difficulty.},

  abstract = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires
decisions about the specification of the appropriate random-effects structure.
Recently, Barr, et al 2013, recommended  fitting `maximal'
models with all possible random effect components included.  Estimation of
maximal models, however, may not converge.  We show that failure to converge
 typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is
a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly
supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum
likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly
informative priors.  Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization
may lead to uninterpretable models.  We provide diagnostic tools for detecting
overparameterization and guiding model simplification.  Finally, we clarify
that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are
atypical for real data.  A detailed example is provided of how subject-related
attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify
statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects
can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.}
